AbstractGraphites are widely used for their high electrical

conductivity and good thermal and chemical stability. In this

work, graphitic carbon-coated lithium titanium (Li4Ti5O12/

GC) was successfully synthesized by a simple one-step

solid-state reaction process with the assistance of sucrose

without elevating sintering temperature. The lattice fringe of

0.208 nm clearly seen from the high-resolution transmission

electron microscopy (HRTEM) images was assigned to graph-

ite (010). The average grain size of the as-prepared Li4Ti5O12/

GC was about 100–200 nm, 1 order smaller than that of pure

Li4Ti5O12prepared similarly. The rate performance and cycle

ability were significantly improved by the hybrid conducting

network formed by graphitic carbon on the grains and amor-

phous carbon between them. The specific capacity retention

rate was 66.7 % when discharged at a rate of 12C compared

with the capacity obtained at 0.5C. After 300 cycles, the

capacity retention was more than 90 % at a high rate of 15C.

Introduction

Lithium ion batteries offering higher power and higher energy

density have been powering most of the portable electronic

devices [1]. Furthermore, the increasing crisis of traditional

energy resources and serious concerns on global environment

are making lithium ion batteries to enable electric vehicles

(EVs) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and be a comple-

ment to wind and solar energy [2,3]. Compared with tradi-

tional carbon-related anodes and alloy anodes, Li4Ti5O12ex-

hibits excellent reversibility between spinel structure and

rock-salt structure after numerous Li+insertion and extraction

processes, which contributes to excellent cycling stability [4].

Together with a high operating potential of 1.55 V vs. Li/Li+

avoiding the formation of lithium dendrites [5], Li4Ti5O12is

proposed as an ideal candidate anode for HEVs and stationary

energy storage [6,7]. Recently, Li4Ti5O12was newly reported

as a wonderful Na+storage material [8]. But the poor rate

performance of pristine Li4Ti5O12caused by low electronic

conductivity (less than 10−13Scm−1[9]) prevents it from

practical use. Many efforts have been made to improve the

electronic conductivity by cation doping (such as K, Al, V,

Nb, etc. [10–13]), surface modification (such as polyacene

[14], carbon [15–18] or N-doped carbon [19–21]), or com-

posites (Li4Ti5O12/TiO2[22–24], Li4Ti5O12/Ag [25],

Li4Ti5O12/Li2Ti3O7[26], etc.). Methods to increase Li+trans-

port ability or shorten Li+diffusion length [27–30]werealso

extensively studied. The carbon coating technique has

attracted much attention due to its simplicity and feasibility,

where a diversity of carbon sources (e.g., pitch [18], ionic

liquid [21], etc.) and fabrication methods (sol-gel method

[17], solid-state reaction [15,16], etc.) were investigated. It

should be noted that most of the carbon layers are in the

amorphous state [31]. It is well known that the conductivity

of graphite is much better than that of amorphous carbon [32].

Generally, the carbon materials can be graphitized until the

critical temperature is over 1,800 °C with a longer treating

period [33]. In this regard, it is understandable why the graph-

itized carbon layer is rarely applied to coat Li4Ti5O12.

Herein, we proposed an economic and easy to be scaled up

route to synthesize graphitized carbon-coated Li4Ti5O12com-

posite in a low temperature. Sucrose was used as a carbon

source, which was mixed with lithium salt and titanium

compound. Then, the mixture was directly sintered by a

simple one-step solid-state reaction. The graphitized carbon

coating layer can efficiently prevent Li4Ti5O12

nanoparticles from aggregation, leading to the feature size

down to around 200 nm. The composite showed excellent

rate performance even charging/discharging at a high current

rate of 12C, which was attributed to the improved electronic

conductivity as well as the reduced Li+diffusion length.

Experimental

TiO 2(anatase, averaged particle diameter 150 nm), Li2CO3,

and sucrose were chosen as the starting materials. Sucrose

accounted for X (X=0, 10, 15, 20) percent of the total weight

of TiO 2and Li2CO3. All the starting materials were mixed in a

liquid medium of acetone and water by a planetary ball mill for

4 h. The ball feed ratio was 5:1. The as-prepared slurry was then

dried at 80 °C and grounded into fine powder for later use.

Following that, the ternary precursor was treated at a rate of

3 °C/min from room temperature to 800 °C in a tube furnace

filled with argon gas, holding the maximum temperature for

12 h and natural cooling afterwards. The as-synthesized sam-

ples were named as LTOCX (X=0, 10, 15, 20).

The morphology of the as-synthesized samples was char-

acterizedbyafieldemissionscanningelectronmicroscope

(FE-SEM, Hitachi, S3400N) and a transmission electron mi-

croscope (TEM, JEOL, JEM-100CX). The phase analysis was

carried out with X-ray diffraction (XRD, X’Pert PRO MPD)

using Cu Kα radiation, and the data was collected with a 2θ

scan ranging from 15° to 85° at a step size of 0.03°. Raman

spectra were measured by a Renishaw inVia Reflex Raman

Microscope at a laser power of 0.5 mW with the excitation

wavelength of 514 nm.

Two-electrode lab cell was assembled in a glove box cir-

culated with argon gas (99.999 %) for electrochemical mea-

surement. To produce the working electrode, the active mate-

rial and acetylene black and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)

were dispersed in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidine (NMP) solution

with a carnelian mortar. The weight ratio of the above three

solid species was set to be 80:10:10. The electrode fabrication

was finished by spreading the grounded mixture on a thin Cu

foil with the doctor-blade method and drying at 110 °C in a

vacuum drying oven for about 12 h before cell assembly. The

counter electrode was of metallic Li foil. The electrolyte was

LiPF 6(1 mol/l) dissolved in the mixture ethylene carbonate,

diethyl carbonate, and dimethyl carbonate (1:1:1 in volume).

The galvanostatic discharge/charge measurements were

conducted on a LAND series battery testing system

(CT2001A, LAND Electronic Co.) at a potential range of

1.0–3.0 V with different discharge/charge rates varying from

 0.2C to 20C. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical

impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were performed on an electro-

chemical work station (Solartron Model 1287/1260A;

Solartron Analytical). CV curves were recorded under a scan

rate of 0.1 mV S−1at a potential range of 1.0–3.0 V. EIS was

performed at a frequency range of 0.01 Hz–1.0 MHz with the

voltage amplitude of 5 mV.

Results and discussion

Morphology characterization and phase identification

Figure 1 exhibits the XRD patterns of the as-synthesized

LTOCX compounds. The pattern of LTOC0 demonstrates

clear peaks located at 2θ degree of 18.3°, 35.6°, 43.2°,

57.2°, and 62.9°, which match the positions and relative

intensities of the spinel Li4Ti5O12diffraction peaks listed in

PDF #49-0207 very well. No impurity phase was identified,

suggesting LTOC0 consists of pristine Li4Ti5O12. While the

amount of carbon source is slightly increased, the XRD pat-

tern does not show a noticeable change considering either the

peak position or the intensity. When the weight ratio of su-

crose is increased to 20 % (LTOC20), unexpected diffraction

peaks of Li 2TiO3and anatase TiO2appear, suggesting the

pyrolyzed carbon retarded the reaction. This phenomenon

was frequently observed while the carbon weight ratio is over

the critical point. All of the XRD curves do not show any

signal of carbon, indicating that the total weight of the carbon

material might be too low or the pyrolyzed carbon is

amorphous.

Ionics

Figure 2 shows the corresponding SEM images of the as-

synthesized LTOCX compounds. As a reference, the SEM

image of the TiO2reactant is also provided. The particle size

of the pristine Li 4Ti5O12(LTOC0) is over 500 nm, and each

particle is well crystallized, exposing very clear and flat facets.

The introduction of 10 % weight of carbon source (LTOC10)

can significantly reduce the particle size [34], in which the

estimated average size is around 200 nm. The smaller particle

will shorten Li +diffusion distance and offer larger reaction

area, which would provide benefit by reducing the electro-

chemical polarization and promoting the rate performance

[35]. With the increased amount of the carbon source, the

product becomes more uniform and its size can be further

decreased slightly. The tendency is consistent with the pub-

lished result, where the TiO2precursor was coated with car-

bon layer prior to the solid-state reaction [16, 36]. However, it

should be mentioned that the particle size of the sample with

the highest carbon ratio (LTOC20) is larger than that of the

TiO 2reactant, suggesting that the aggregation occurred in the

process of thermal annealing. Even though the carbon source

ratio was up to 20 % (LTOC20), it is still very difficult to

identify if the pyrolyzed carbon is coated on Li4Ti5O12nano-

particles by SEM imaging. TEM and high-resolution trans-

mission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of the com-

posite LTOC15 are given in Fig. 3. Figure 3a exhibits a low

magnification TEM image, where the particle size is around

 200 nm. It is in accordance with SEM observation. The spider

network is visible in the neighboring particle, which must be

made of pyrolytic carbon. The enlarged TEM image exhibits

that the carbon material is potted uniformly on the surface of

well-crystallized Li4Ti5O12grains. The HRTEM image illus-

trates that there are clear strip lines for each dot, and the

spacing of the lattice fringe is 0.208 nm, which can be

assigned to graphite (010). The maximum height of the dot

is around 4 nm, and the minimum height is around 1 nm. More

importantly, the neighboring dots are overlapped. That is to

say, a serrated graphitized carbon layer is successfully coated

on Li 4Ti5O12.

In order to make sure that graphitized carbon was formed in

the macroscopic area, Raman spectrum was collected as

shown in Fig. 4. The peaks located at 1,340 and 1,595 cm−1

can be assigned to D and G bands, respectively. It is common

knowledge that D band represents the vibration mode from

amorphous carbon and G band originates from graphitized

carbon [37]. The two peaks have comparable intensity, sug-

gesting that the two types of carbon may have similar weight

ratio. A large amount of defects on the surface of graphite

grains also contributes to the low peak intensity ratio of the G

band to D band [38]. According to HRTEM result, it can be

easy to know that the particle is coated with graphitized

carbon, and the neighboring particles were connected with

amorphous carbon network. The nature of the starting material

(sucrose) is suggested to be the shifts of the Raman peaks of

carbon [39].

This result was different from that discussed in former

works in which amorphous carbon was detected [24, 40].

The cooperation of relatively higher synthesis temperature

and longer annealing time was suggested to be one of the

reasons of graphitization. Atmosphere was another factor that

affects the graphitization. The carbon layer tended to be amor-

phous if synthesized in NH3atmosphere reported in our

previous work [20].

Electrochemical performance

The typical charge/discharge profiles of LTOC15 at different

current rates are shown in Fig. 5. The average initial specific

capacity was 183 mAh g −1when charged-discharged at a rate

of 0.5C, which is slightly higher than the theoretical value.

The possible reason is that graphitic carbon exhibits electro-

chemical double layer capacitance effect above 1.0 V [41].

Due to the good conductivity of graphitic carbon coating

outside the particles, the batteries prepared with sample

LTOC15 show the best rate performance among all the sam-

ples. As shown in Fig.6, high capacity retentions as 154, 136,

 127, 114, and 102 mAh g−1were obtained even after being

charged-discharged at 0.5C, 1C, 2C, 7C, and 12C for 100 cy-

cles. Al foil was used as the current collector for comparison.

The capacities are 155, 133, 116, 88, and 67 mAh g−1,respec-

tively, which are much lower than those of the batteries with

Cu foil as the current collector. The tendency agrees with the

result reported by Hu [42]. The coulombic efficiency is over

96 % after the second cycle and almost 100 % afterwards.

After 300 cycles, the capacity retention at a high level of more

than 90 % was achieved with a high discharge-charge rate of

7C and 15C, respectively (shown in Fig. 7). To compare the

rate performance of all the samples, the normalization of the

capacity variations based on the capacity at 0.5C is exhibited

in Fig. 8. Sample LTOC15 performed much better than that of

sample LTOC0, but slightly better than that of sample

LTOC20. It suggests that for sample LTOC15, a thin graphitic

carbon layer on the grains and the pyrolyzed carbon among

them have formed a nearly complete conducting network and

improved the electron conductivity significantly. The smaller

grain size and less agglomeration also contribute to the im-

provement. The results agree with TEM and Raman spectra

well. The graphitic layer on the grains of sample LTOC20 is a

little thicker, which prevents Li+from fast transport just like

the case discussed in our previous work [20], that is why there

is no further obvious improvement for sample LTOC20.

The irreversible capacity decline in the first cycle is pre-

sented in Table 1. The increased phase impurity in the samples

is suggested to be the main reason of the capacity decline in

the first cycle with the increasing weight ratio of sucrose

involved [43].

To further demonstrate the effect of the graphitic carbon

layer on the active materials. The first three cycles of CV

measurement of samples LTOC0 and LTOC15 are shown in

Fig. 9. Checking the figure, one dominant couple of redox

peaks is observed while scanning at a rate of 0.1 mV S−1.For

pure Li 4Ti5O12, the cathodic peak and the anodic peak are

located at 1.40 and 1.78 V, respectively, while for LTOC15,

the two peaks are located at 1.45 and 1.66 V, which demon-

strates that the graphitic carbon layer improves the electronic

conductivity of the active materials. The coincidence of one to

three cycles of the CV curves indicated the stability and

reversibility of the discharge and charge process for pure

and carbon-coated samples. This further indicates that there

is no side effect when introducing sucrose (pyrolyzed carbon)

in the material sintering process.

The AC impedance spectra were measured to further un-

derstand the conductivity of the graphite-coated Li4Ti5O12

material. The data are given in Fig. 10. The equivalent circuit

is shown as an inset. Rctof LTOC15, the equivalent resistance

of the impedance caused by the electrochemical reaction

 activity at the interface between active material and electro-

lyte, is fitted to be 86Ω, which is much smaller than that of

pure Li4Ti5O12(170Ω). The result is comparable or better

than the results mentioned in the literature [24, 44–46].

Conclusions

Graphitic carbon-coated Li4Ti5O12of high rate performance

and good cycle stability was successfully achieved with the

assistance of sucrose, which is cheap, environmentally friend-

ly, and abundant in nature by a simple, short-time consump-

tion, one-step solid-state reaction process. In this work, XRD,

SEM, and TEM were carried out to study the physical char-

acteristics. At both the aids of sucrose film coating on the

grains of Li 2CO3and TiO2, the average grain size of the as-

prepared graphite carbon-coated Li4Ti5O12was tested to be

around 100–200 nm, 1 order smaller than pristine Li4Ti5O12

prepared similarly. A good conducting network formed by

graphitic carbon and pyrolyzed carbon can be seen from

TEM photos. The less agglomeration and reduced grain size

made the lithium ion diffusion much easier. As a result, the

Li4Ti5O12were significantly improved. The specific capacity

retained 66.7 % even at a rate of 12C compared with the

capacity achieved when discharged at 0.5C. After the 300th

cycle, the specific capacity retention was more than 90 % at a

high rate of 15C. The work in this article is expected to be

used in the mass production.
