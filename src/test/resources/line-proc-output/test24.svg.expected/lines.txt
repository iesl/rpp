ABSTRACT: Reaction of manganese, iron, and nickel thiocyanate with 4-

ethylpyridine leads to the formation of single crystals of compounds with

composition M(NCS)2(L)4(1), M(NCS)2(L)2(H2O)2(2-Mn), and M-

(NCS) 2(L)2(3) with M = Mn, Fe, and Ni and L = 4-ethylpyridine. For most

compounds, diﬀerent polymorphic modiﬁcations are observed, and their

transition behavior and thermodynamic stability was investigated. Additionally,

compounds of composition M(NCS)2(L)2(M = Mn or Ni) were prepared from

solution and by thermal decomposition of compounds 1 and 2, which lead to

diﬀerent stable and metastable modiﬁcations. The crystal structures of most

compounds were determined by single crystal X-ray diﬀraction and some of them

by Rietveld reﬁnements. Compounds 1 and 2 consist of octahedrally coordinated

discrete complexes with terminal N-bonded thiocyanato anions. In compounds 3,

the metal cations are linked by pairs of μ-1,3-bridging thiocyanato anions into

chains. Surprisingly, thermal decomposition of Ni(NCS)2(4-ethylpyridine)4leads to the formation of a new compound of

composition Ni(NCS) 2(4-ethylpyridine) (4-Ni). Magnetic measurements reveal that 3-Mn/II and 3-Mn/III show

antiferromagnetic ordering at TN= 21.5 and 23.9 K and that 4-Ni is a metamagnet with a critical ﬁeld of 1.4 kOe at 2 K.

All other compounds show Curie or Curie−Weiss behavior with no magnetic anomalies.

■INTRODUCTION

Recently, investigations on new synthetic routes for novel

coordination compounds, inorganic−organic hybrid materials,

and metal−organic frameworks with desired physical properties

stand at the frontiers of inorganic chemistry research.1−9For

that purpose, diﬀerent strategies for a rational design of speciﬁc

structures need to be developed, and structure−property

relationships need to be investigated in detail. 10−20Besides

the chemical synthesis itself, a major issue is governing the

formation of a desired polymorph (or isomer), since poly-

morphism is a usual feature of coordination compounds.21−32

In this context, special attention should be paid to the phase

transition within diﬀerent polymorphs, the way in which they

can be crystallized in pure form, and their relative stability, that

is to ﬁnd the thermodynamically stable forms.23−27

Concerning the physical properties of coordination com-

pounds, materials showing cooperative magnetic phenomena

are of special interest. Those phenomena can emerge when

paramagnetic transition metal atoms are linked by neutral or

anionic ligands, which can mediate magnetic exchange

interactions.33−42Within the scope of our ongoing inves-

tigations on the magnetic properties of coordination com-

pounds based on transition metal thio- and selenocyanates, we

synthesized a number of diﬀerent materials. Some of them,

 together with selected examples from the literature are given in

the reference list.43−58However, the preparation of such

compounds in which the metal cations are linked by bridging

anionic ligands is sometimes diﬃcult to achieve if the synthesis

is performed in solution. Therefore, we have developed an

alternative, solid-state route based on thermal decomposition of

suitable precursors. 59−61It should be noted that preparation of

coordination compounds by solid state methods is not

uncommon and diﬀerent methods were reported.62−68Given

that our aim is building up a thio- and selenocyanate bonded

network of metal cations, we decided to start with complexes

where the metal cations are octahedrally coordinated by four

neutral N-donor coligands and two terminal N-bonded thio- or

selenocyanato anions. Upon heating, the coligands are removed

in a stepwise fashion, and in most cases, the octahedral

coordination is retained during ligand removal, which enforces

the formation of desired samples in which the metal cations are

linked by μ-1,3-bridging anionic ligands. The new materials are

obtained in quantitative yield, in most cases as single phases

and sometimes as polymorphic modiﬁcations. 23,26,27,61As

expected, most of them exhibit cooperative magnetic

phenomena, including metamagnetic behavior.69−75Within

this project, for example, 1D-linked samples of composition

M(NCS) 2(pyridine)2(M = Mn, Fe, Co, or Ni) were

investigated. The Mn compound was shown to be an

antiferromagnet, while the Fe and Ni analogues are

metamagnets, and for the Co containing sample, a slow

relaxation of the magnetization was observed.75,76To

determine whether this interesting magnetic behavior is

retained on ligand exchange, we prepared Co(NCS) 2(4-

ethylpyridine) 2. This material exhibits a very similar structure

to that of Co(NCS)2(pyridine)2but is a metamagnet that

shows metamagnetism and slow relaxations below and above

the critical ﬁeld. 77Motivated by this ﬁnding and in order to

study the inﬂuence of the metal cation, we focused on 4-

ethylpyridine as ligand. To the best of our knowledge only

Ni(NCS) 2(4-ethylpyridine)4existing in two polymorphs (1-

Ni/I and 1-Ni/II) is reported in the literature.78Additionally,

some solvates of Ni(NCS) 2(4-ethylpyridine)4are also

reported. 78

Accordingly, various materials crystallizing in diﬀerent

polymorphic modiﬁcations were prepared and structurally

characterized by single crystal X-ray diﬀraction and by Rietveld

reﬁnements (Table 1). Interestingly, we obtained an unusual

ligand-deﬁcient compound of composition [Ni(NCS)2(4-ethyl-

pyridine)] n(4-Ni), which shows metamagnetic behavior.

■EXPERIMENTAL SECTION

Materials and General Methods. All chemicals and solvents

were used without further puriﬁcation. NiCl2·6H2O, FeSO4·7H2O,

KNCS, MnSO 4·2H2O, Ba(NCS)2·3H2O, and 4-ethylpyridine were

obtained from Alfa Aesar. Mn(NCS) 2was prepared by a reaction of

equimolar amounts of MnSO 4·2H2O and Ba(NCS)2·3H2O in water.

The resulting precipitate of BaSO 4was ﬁltered oﬀ, and the ﬁltrate was

evaporated to complete dryness resulting in a white residue of

Mn(NCS) 2. The desired complexes (see Results and Discussion) were

prepared by stirring diﬀerent molar ratios of the reactants for 3 days.

The residues obtained were ﬁltered oﬀ, washed with water and diethyl

ether, and dried in vacuum.

 Elemental Analysis. All synthesized samples were investigated by

CHNS analysis using a EURO EA elemental analyzer (EURO

VECTOR Instruments).

X-ray Powder Diﬀraction (XRPD). The measurements were

performed using (1) a PANalytical X’Pert Pro MPD reﬂection

diﬀractometer with Cu Kα radiation equipped with a PIXcel

semiconductor detector and (2) a Stoe transmission powder

diﬀraction system (STADI-P) with Cu Kα radiation that is equipped

with a linear position-sensitive detector. The data collection of the

patterns used for Rietveld reﬁnement was performed on high-

resolution powder diﬀractometer Bruker D8 Advance with Ge(111)-

Johanson-type monochromator and VÅNTEC-1 position sensitive

detector in Debye−Scherrer geometry.

Rietveld Reﬁnements. The Rietveld reﬁnements were performed

using the program suite TOPAS 4.2, and selected crystallographic data

are listed in Table 2.79The following overall parameters were

subjected to reﬁnement: phase scale factor, background coeﬃcients

(Chebyshev polynomials of order smaller than 10), unit cell

parameters, zero-error shift, and parameters for the strain contribution.

The displacement factors were treated isotropically. Despite the use of

capillaries in Debye−Scherrer geometry, a small amount of the

preferred orientation was detected and was adequately described by

the use of symmetry-adapted spherical harmonics. The metal cations

were allowed to move freely, while for the ligands rigid bodies were

created and their x, y, z fractional positions, together with bond

distances, angles, and torsions were reﬁned.

IR Spectroscopy. IR spectroscopy was performed using an ATI

Mattson Genesis series FTIR spectrometer.

Diﬀerential Thermal Analysis and Thermogravimetry (DTA-

TG). The measurements were performed in nitrogen atmosphere

(purity 5.0) in Al 2O3crucibles using a NETZSCH STA-409CD

thermobalance. The instrument was calibrated using standard

reference materials. All measurements were performed with a heating

rate of 4 K min −1and a low rate of 75 mL min−1.

Diﬀerential Scanning Calorimetry. The DSC experiments were

performed using a DSC 1 star system with STARe Excellence software

from Mettler-Toledo AG.

Magnetic Measurements. All magnetic measurements were

performed using a Quantum Design PPMS (Physical Property

Measurement System), equipped with a 9 T magnet. The data were

corrected for core diamagnetism.

Single-Crystal Structure Analysis. Data collection was carried

out using a two imaging plate diﬀraction system from Stoe (IPDS-1 for

1-Fe/I, 2-Mn, 3-Ni/II, and 3-Mn/III and IPDS-2 for 1-Mn/III, 1-

Mn/IV, 1-Fe/II, and 3-Ni/I) using Mo Kα radiation. For some

compounds, a numerical absorption correction was performed (see

Table 3). The structures were solved with direct methods using

SHELXS-97, and structure reﬁnements were performed against F2

using SHELXL-97.80Numerical absorption corrections were applied

using X-RED and X-SHAPE of the program package X-Area.

Hydrogen atoms were reﬁned with anisotropic displacement

parameters. All hydrogen atoms were positioned with idealized

geometry and were reﬁned isotropically with Uiso(H) = 1.2Ueq(C)

(1.5 for methyl H atoms) using a riding model. The water H atoms in

compound 2-Mn were located in a diﬀerence Fourier map, their bond

lengths were set to ideal values, and ﬁnally they were reﬁned using a

riding model with U iso(H) = 1.5Ueq(O). In 1-Mn/IV, 1-Fe/I, 1-Fe/II,

2-Mn, 3-Ni/I, and 3-Ni/II, some C atoms of the ethyl groups are

disordered and were reﬁned using a split model. Compound 3-Ni/II is

racemically twinned, and therefore, a twin reﬁnement was performed

(BASF parameter = 0.58(2)). Platon does not suggest higher

symmetry, and all other attempts to transform the structure in the

centrosymmetric space goup fail. Details of the structure determi-

nation are given in Table 3.

■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Synthetic Investigations in Solution. In the classical,

solution based synthesis, diﬀerent molar ratios of M(NCS)2(M

= Ni, Mn, or Fe) were reacted with 4-ethylpyridine in water

(Table 4), and the residues obtained were investigated by

XRPD, elemental analysis, and IR spectroscopy. The procedure

was repeated using methanol, ethanol, and acetonitrile, and the

results are given in the Supporting Information, Table S1.

In the cases using coligand rich solution (1:4 and 1:2 ratios),

compounds of composition M(NCS) 2(4-ethylpyridine)4were

obtained. The XRPD patterns show that the crystal structures

of the Ni and Fe complexes (1-Ni/II and 1-Fe/II) are isotypic

to the reported polymorphic modiﬁcation 1-Ni/II. 78The Mn

complex, however, gave a diﬀerent pattern indicating that a

further modiﬁcation (1-Mn/III) is formed. For all of these

complexes, the value of the asymmetric CN stretching vibration

indicated that the thiocyanato anions are terminally N-bonded

to the metal cations [ν as(CN) = 2066 cm−1for 1-Ni/II, 2044

cm −1for 1-Mn/III,2047cm−1for 1-Fe/II (Supporting

Information, Figure S1)]. The Fe cation did not form any

complex with the coligand when the ratio of M(NCS)2and 4-

ethylpyridine was 1:1, 2:1, and 4:1. In contrast, the Ni cation

reacted in each of the three ratios, giving a complex of

composition Ni(NCS) 2(4-ethylpyridine)2(3-Ni/II) with μ-1,3

bridging anionic ligands [ν as(CN) = 2112 cm−1(Supporting

 Information, Figure S1)]. The Mn cation, in solutions where

the Mn(NCS)2and 4-ethylpyridine ratios were 1:1 and 2:1,

formed a aqua complex of a composition Mn(NCS)2(4-

ethylpyridine) 2(H2O)2(2-Mn) with terminal N-bonded

anionic ligands [ν as(CN) = 2085 cm−1(Supporting Informa-

tion, Figure S1)]. With increasing concentration of the metal

salt (4:1 ratio), a 4-ethylpyridine-deﬁcient compound with

bridging anionic ligands of composition Mn(NCS)2(4-ethyl-

pyridine) 2was obtained in the polymorphic modiﬁcation III

(3-Mn/III)[νas(CN) = 2091 cm−1(Supporting Information,

Figure S1)]. In the other solvents, no further crystalline phases

were obtained but in, for example, acetonitrile the aqua

complex 2-Mn cannot be obtained because of the low water

content in the solutions (Supporting Information, Table S1).

In further crystallization experiments, single crystals of the

coligand rich complexes (1-Fe/I, 1-FeII, 1-Mn/III, and 1-Mn/

IV), the aqua complex (2-Mn), and the 4-ethylpyridine-

deﬁcient compounds (3-Ni/I, 3-Ni/II, and 3-Mn/III) were

obtained.

In order to prove the phase purity of the complexes, their

XRPD patterns (1-Ni/II, 1-Mn/III, 1-Mn/IV, 1-FeII, 2-Mn, 3-

Ni/I, 3-Ni/II, and 3-Mn/III) were collected and compared

with patterns simulated from the single crystal structures

(Supporting Information, Figure S2). It was proven that all

modiﬁcations were obtained as single phases, except 1-Mn/III,

which crystallized in a mixture with 1-Mn/IV, which was not

detected in the IR measurements.

Crystal Structure of the Compounds of Composition

M(NCS) 2(4-ethylpyridine)4. For the complexes of composi-

tion M(NCS) 2(4-ethylpyridine)4, four diﬀerent crystal struc-

tures were observed. Forms I and II of Fe(NCS)2(4-

ethylpyridine) 4crystallize in the triclinic space group P1̅ and

are isotypic to 1-Ni/I and 1-Ni/II, which were reported several

years ago. 78The asymmetric unit in both modiﬁcations consists

of two crystallographically independent iron(II) cations, four

thiocyanato anions, and eight neutral coligands, all of them

situated on a general position (Supporting Information, Figure

S3−S4).

The Mn compounds crystallize in two diﬀerent crystal

structures, III and IV. Form 1-Mn/III crystallizes in the

monoclinic space group P21/c, where the asymmetric unit

consists of two crystallographically independent manganese(II)

cations located on centers of inversion, two thiocyanato anions,

and four 4-ethylpyridine ligands that occupy general positions

(Supporting Information, Figure S5). Form 1-Mn/IV crystal-

lizes in space group P1̅, with four formula units in the unit cell

and three crystallographically independent Mn(II) cations, two

of them located on centers of inversion (Supporting

Information, Figure S6). In all compounds, the metal cations

are coordinated by two N-bonded thiocyanato anions and four

4-ethylpyridine ligands building slightly distorted octahedra

(Figure 1, left).

The M−N distances range from 2.085(2) to 2.346(3) Å and

are comparable to those in similar compounds (Supporting

Information, Table S2−S5). The diﬀerences in the crystal

structures are predominantly found in the arrangement of the

discrete complexes in the crystal structure (Supporting

Information, Figures S7−S8).

general position (Supporting Information, Figure S9). In the

crystal structure, discrete complexes are found in which the Mn

cations are coordinated by two N-bonded thiocyanato anions,

two 4-ethylpyridine ligands, and two water molecules within a

slightly distorted octahedral geometry. The Mn−N and Mn−O

distances range from 2.189(2) to 2.2626(19) Å, and the angles

are 84.93(8)°, 95.07(8)°, and 180° (Supporting Information,

Table S6). In the crystal structure, the discrete complexes are

connected by intermolecular OH···S hydrogen bonding with

H···S distances of 2.525 and 2.515 Å (Supporting Information,

Figure S10).

Polymorph 3-Ni/II crystallizes in the monoclinic space group

Cc with eight formula units in the unit cell. The asymmetric

unit consists of two crystallographically independent nickel(II)

cations, four thiocyanato anions, and four 4-ethylpyridine

ligands all situated on a general position (Supporting

Information, Figure S12). Signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the

two Ni modiﬁcations are found in the packing of the chains. In

3-Ni/I, they are arranged in layers, whereas in 3-Ni/II, a typical

sandwich-herringbone arrangement is found, similar to that in

3-Mn/III (Supporting Information, Figure S13).

Compound 3-Mn/III crystallizes in the monoclinic space

group P2 1/c with two formula units in the unit cell. The

asymmetric unit consists of one manganese(II) cation located

on a center of inversion, one thiocyanato anion, and one 4-

ethylpyridine ligand on general positions (Supporting In-

formation, Figure S14). In the crystal structure, each metal(II)

cation is coordinated by two N-bonded and two S-bonded

thiocyanato anions, as well as two trans-coordinated 4-

ethylpyridine ligands in a slightly distorted octahedral geometry

(Figure 2).

The M−N and M−S distances ranges from 2.033(3) to

2.7381(4) Å with angles around the metal(II) cations between

 85.33(12)° and 94.80(12)° and between 178.3(2)° and 180°

(Supporting Information, Table S7−S9). Each metal(II) cation

is linked by pairs of μ-1,3-bridging thiocyanato anions into

chains (Figure 2). The metal−metal separation within these

chains amounts to 5.5861(4) Å for 3-Ni/I, 5.5738(11) Å for 3-

Ni/II, and 5.7737(4) Å for 3-Mn/III. The shortest interchain

distances are 10.5105(9) Å in 3-Ni/I, 8.5959(13) Å in 3-Ni/II,

and 8.5647(6) Å in 3-Mn/III.

Investigations on the Stability of the 1:4 Modiﬁca-

tions. In order to determine which of the two Mn

modiﬁcations is thermodynamically more stable in room

temperature conditions, solvent mediated conversion experi-

ments were performed. Saturated solutions of a mixture of 1-

Mn/III and 1-Mn/IV with additional crystalline powder were

stirred for a prolonged time, and afterward the residue was

investigated by XRPD (Figure 3). After 5 days, form IV

disappeared, clearly proving that form III is thermodynamically

more stable and strongly indicating that 1-Mn/IV is obtained

by kinetic control in the solution based synthesis (Table 1).

For the previously published polymorphs I and II of Ni, no

solvent mediated conversion experiments were performed

because in our polymorph screening experiments using

diﬀerent solvents only 1-Ni/II was obtained, indicating that

this polymorph is the thermodynamically more stable form at

room temperature. As previously mentioned, only a few crystals

of 1-Fe/I were accidently obtained in a mixture with 1-Fe/II.

On storage, these crystals transformed rapidly into 1-Fe/II,

proving that (as for Ni) form II is also the thermodynamically

stable form at room temperature.

Thermoanalytical Investigations. The thermal properties

of the 1:4 compounds 1 and of 2-Mn were investigated by

simultaneous diﬀerential thermoanalysis and thermogravimetry

(DTA-TG), diﬀerential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and

temperature-dependent X-ray powder diﬀraction (HT-XRPD).

On heating to 300 °C, compounds 1-Ni/II, 1-Mn/III, 1-Fe/

II, and 2-Mn exhibited several mass reductions in the TG

curve, accompanied by endothermic events in the DTA curves

(Figure 4 and Supporting Information, Figure S15). For

compounds 1, the experimental mass loss during the ﬁrst TG

step is in a good agreement with the calculated mass loss for the

removal of half of the 4-ethylpyridine ligands, whereas in the

second step only one of the ligands is lost (Table 5). The

experimental mass change of Δmexp= 14.6% in the ﬁrst step of

2-Mn is in agreement with the loss of two water molecules, and

in the second step, half of the 4-ethylpyridine ligands evaporate.

On further heating, the remaining ligands are removed, leading

to the formation of the metal(II) thiocyanates, which

subsequently decompose. Based on these observations, it can

be assumed that all of them decompose into compounds of

composition M(NCS) 2(4-ethylpyridine)2in the ﬁrst step.

These might transform into 1:1 compounds of composition

M(NCS) 2(4-ethylpyridine) during the second step.

 To verify the composition of these intermediates, the TG

measurements were stopped after the ﬁrst weight loss step, and

the residues were investigated by XRPD, elemental analysis,

and IR spectroscopy. IR spectroscopy indicates that the metal

cations are linked by μ-1,3-bridging thiocyanato anions

(Supporting Information, Figure S16).

XRPD measurements reveal that the residues obtained in the

ﬁrst heating step of 1-Ni/II, 1-Mn/III, and 1-Fe/II are isotypic

and correspond to the structure of 3-Ni/II, a compound

already obtained in solution (Figure 5, top).

Interestingly, in the case of Fe, a new compound of

composition Fe(NCS)2(4-ethylpyridine)2(3-Fe/II) was ob-

tained, for which there is no evident access using solution-based

synthesis methods. Similarly, the thermal decompositions of 1-

Mn/III leads to the formation of the corresponding polymorph

II (3-Mn/II), which also was not obtained during the solution-

based synthesis. The crystal structures of these forms were

obtained by the Rietveld method (Table 2 and Supporting

Information, Figure S17−S18).

However, the experimental X-ray powder pattern of the

residue obtained in the ﬁrst TG step of the aqua complex 2-Mn

shows that a mixture of modiﬁcation II and III of Mn-

(NCS) 2(4-ethylpyridine)2has formed (Figure 5, bottom).

According to a two-phase Rietveld reﬁnement, 3-Mn/II and

3-Mn/III have formed in ratio 26.4:73.6 (Supporting

Information, Figure S19).

The residues obtained in the second TG step of 1-Mn/III, 1-

Fe/II, and 2-Mn gave amorphous XRPD patterns. The residue

obtained by thermal decomposition of 1-Ni/II, however, was of

good crystallinity. Moreover, no reﬂections of the 1:2

compound and of Ni(NCS)2are present, and the elemental

analysis is in agreement with that calculated for the

composition Ni(NCS) 2(4-ethylpyridine) (4-Ni, Figure 6).

This is further supported by the fact that diﬀerent batches of

this compound show identical XRPD patterns (Supporting

Information, Figure S20). Unfortunately all attempts to index

this pattern failed, and we cannot exclude that small amounts of

a second phase are present. However, the magnetic measure-

ments gave no hints of contaminations. However, in the IR

spectrum of this compound, the νas(CN) stretching vibration is

observed at 2139 and 2117 cm −1(Supporting Information,

Figure S20). These values are in agreement with the presence

of μ-1,1,3-bridging thiocyanato anions and indicates that a

more condensed 1D network has formed, which should be

similar to that in [Cd(NCS) 2(4-ethylpyridine)]n(νas(CN) =

2124 and 2107 cm −1) and [Cd(NCS)2(pyridine)]n(νas(CN) =

2120 and 2105 cm −1) reported recently (Supporting

Information, Figure S21).81

To investigate the thermal properties of compounds 1 in

greater detail and to check for polymorphic transformations not

detected by the DTA investigations, DSC and temperature

dependent XRPD measurements were performed.

The DSC curve of 1-Mn/III is characterized by several

endothermic events, observed up to 250 °C (Figure 7). There

is one additional less intense signal at about 93 °C, not visible

in the DTA curves. The XRPD investigations clearly prove that

this event corresponds to a transformation into a new form (1-

Mn/I) that was not obtained by crystallization from solution

and that is isotypic to 1-Ni/I and 1-Fe/I (Figure 7).

Accordingly, it can be concluded that 1-Mn/I becomes stable

at higher temperatures, and because the transition is

endothermic, form I and form III are supposed to behave

enantiotropically. On further heating, transformation into 4-

ethylpyridine deﬁcient compound Mn(NCS)2(4-ethylpyri-

dine) 2(3-Mn/II) is observed at 163 °C (Figure 4 and

Supporting Information, Figure S22). Additional DSC signals at

higher temperatures (197 and 221 °C) correspond to a

transformation into new amorphous phases. These results are

in agreement with the temperature dependent XRPD measure-

ments, which show that 1-Mn/III transforms into 3-Mn/II via

1-Mn/I as an intermediate (Supporting Information, Figure

S23).However,incontrasttoourDTA-TGandDSC

measurements, additional crystalline phases are formed at

higher temperatures (Supporting Information, Figure S22).

The DSC measurements of 1-Fe/II gave no hints for

transformation into a new modiﬁcation but only decomposition

into [Fe(NCS)2(4-ethylpyridine)2]n(3-Fe/II, as already

observed in the DTA-TG measurements (Supporting Informa-

tion, Figure S23)). It should be noted that crystalline 3-Fe/II

was not detected in our HT-XRPD measurements of 1-Fe/II

because this compound directly decomposes into an

amorphous phase. However, the formation of either a

crystalline or an amorphous phase is not surprising, given

that the outcome of such thermoanalytical measurements

depends on a number of parameters like the heating rate and

the atmosphere used in the experiment.

The DSC measurements on 1-Ni/II show transformation

into 1-Ni/I, indicating that the latter modiﬁcation becomes

more stable at higher temperatures (Supporting Information,

Figure S24). This is in agreement with our investigations on the

corresponding Mn modiﬁcation, 1-Mn/III. On further heating,

1-Ni/I transforms into 4-Ni via 3-Ni/II as intermediate, as

already observed in the DTA-TG measurements. Similar results

were obtained by the HT-XRPD measurements. Surprisingly,

small diﬀerences are found in the powder pattern of 4-Ni

obtained by the DTA-TG and DSC measurements and the one

measured by HT-XRPD at about 270 °C. These diﬀerences

cannot be traced back to an anisotropic shift of the lattice

parameters because when the phase observed at high

temperatures is measured afterward at room temperature the

diﬀerences are still present. A high-temperature phase transition

of 4-Ni can also be excluded; when this compound is

investigated by HT-XRPD measurements, it decomposes

directly into Ni(NCS) 2without any previous transformation.

Therefore, obviously a new high temperature phase has formed

in the XRPD measurements that is not observed in the DTA-

TG and DSC measurements.

Investigations on the Stability of 3-Ni/I and 3-Ni/II.

Numerous synthesis trials showed that almost always 3-Ni/II is

obtained in solution. Surprisingly, a few single crystals of a

second polymorph, 3-Ni/I, were accidently obtained. In order

to check whether 3-Ni/I is formed by kinetic control and is

supposed to transform into 3-Ni/II, nickel(II) thiocyanate and

4-ethylpyridine were stirred in ratio 1:2 in water, and the

residues obtained were investigated by XRPD as a function of

time. At early stages, the solution become deep blue colored,

and 1:4 compound 1-Ni/II was formed. Afterward, trans-

formation into a light blue colored crystalline powder of 3-Ni/I

is observed, which transformed into a light green colored

crystalline powder of 3-Ni/II. It can be concluded that 3-Ni/II

represents the thermodynamically stable form at room

temperature (Figure 8). Additionally, DSC and temperature

dependent XRPD measurements on 3-Ni/I and 3-Ni/II gave

no hints for polymorphic transformations.

Investigations on the Stability of 3-Mn/II and 3-Mn/III.

To prove which of the two diﬀerent 1:2 modiﬁcations, 3-Mn/II

or 3-Mn/III, represents the thermodynamically most stable

form at room-temperature, a solvent mediated conversion

experiment was performed. Mixture of 3-Mn/II and 3-Mn/III

was stirred in a saturated solution in ethanol at room

temperature for 3 days. Afterward, the residues were ﬁltered

and investigated by XRPD. It was shown that 3-Mn/II

transforms into 3-Mn/III, which is the thermodynamically

stable form (Figure 9). Additional DSC and XRPD measure-

ments on forms 3-Mn/II and 3-Mn/III gave no hint for

additional polymorphic transformations.

Thermodynamic Relations and Transformations be-

tween All Compounds. In the investigations presented

above, several compounds of composition M(NCS)2(4-ethyl-

 pyridine)4and [M(NCS)2(4-ethylpyridine)2]nwere obtained,

crystallizing in diﬀerent modiﬁcations. On stirring, trans-

formation of 1-Mn/III into the thermodynamically more stable

form 1-Mn/IV is observed (Figure 10). 1-Mn/III is also

formed as an intermediate in the solution based synthesis and,

therefore, is clearly metastable at room temperature. On

heating 1-Mn/III, a polymorphic endothermic transformation

into 1-Mn/I is observed, proving that the latter is more stable

at higher temperatures and that both forms behave

enantiotropically. Surprisingly, for Mn and Ni, form I is already

obtained at room temperature, but it is metastable and

transforms into the stable form II, which was not obtained

for Mn (Figure 10). It should be noted that on heating 1-Ni/II

transforms into 1-Ni/I in an endothermic reaction; therefore

both forms behave enantiotropically with form I being stable at

higher temperatures, as was the case for Mn.

On heating of 1-Mn/III, 1-Fe/II, and 1-Ni/II, half of the

ligands are removed and transformations into new compounds

of composition M(NCS)2(4-ethylpyridine)2are observed. In

those cases, all compounds are isotypic and crystallize as form

3-M/II (Figure 10). Further experiments, however, show that

for Mn this crystalline phase is only stable at higher

temperatures, whereas at room temperature and in solution it

transforms to 3-Mn/III. In the case of Fe, this 4-ethylpyridine

deﬁcient compound cannot be obtained from solution, whereas

for Ni, form II represents the thermodynamically stable form

already at room temperature. As it can be seen, the 4-

ethylpyridine deﬁcient modiﬁcations of Mn and Ni behave

diﬀerently.

It should be noted that for Ni a second polymorph (3-Ni/I)

exists that is metastable at room temperature and transforms

into the stable form 3-Ni/II (Figure 10). However, at higher

temperature, additional crystalline phases are observed whose

structures are still unknown.

Magnetic Investigations. For compounds 1-Ni/II, 1-Mn/

III, 1-Mn/IV, 1-Fe/II, and 2-Mn, the temperature dependence

of the susceptibility was investigated in the temperature range

of 300−2 K applying a magnetic ﬁeld of H DC= 1 kOe, and for

all compounds, a simple Curie−Weiss paramagnetic behavior

without any anomaly was observed (Supporting Information,

Figure S25). Upon analysis of the magnetic data according to

the Curie−Weiss law, χ M= C/(T − θ) yields a Weiss constant

 of θ = 3.4 K for 1-Ni/II, θ = 0.1 K for 1-Mn/III, θ = −0.9 K for

1-Fe/II, θ = −0.38 K for 2-Mn, and θ = −35.0 K for 1-Mn/IV,

indicating relatively strong antiferromagnetic interactions for

the latter (Supporting Information, Table S10).

Surprisingly, a similar behavior is observed for 3-Ni/I and 3-

Ni/II, even though in these compounds the cations are linked

by μ-1,3-bridging thiocyanato anions (Supporting Information,

Figure S25). Fitting the magnetic data according to the Curie−

Weiss law lead to a Weiss constant of θ = 4.6 K for 3-Ni/I and

θ =3.9Kfor3-Ni/II, indicating weak ferromagnetic

interactions (Table 6). For 3-Fe/II, a similar behavior was

found, and θ was determined to be 1.6 K (Table 6 and

Supporting Information, Figure S25).

In contrast, for 3-Mn/II, a sharp maximum is observed in the

χMversus T curve indicating antiferromagnetic ordering at TN=

21.5 K (Figure 11, top). The same behavior is found for 3-Mn/

III, but T Nis shifted slightly to 23.9 K (Figure 11, bottom).

Fitting the magnetic data according to the Curie−Weiss law

yields a strong negative Weiss constant of θ = −36.1 K for 3-

Mn/II and of −39.2 K for 3-Mn/III indicating relatively strong

antiferromagnetic interactions (Table 6). To check for

metamagnetic behavior, initial curves at 2 K up to 90 kOe

were measured, which show a behavior typical for antiferro-

magnets in the case of 3-Mn/II and 3-Mn/III (Supporting

Information, Figure S26).

Magnetic measurement on 4-Ni at HDC= 1 kOe showed

antiferromagnetic ordering at T N= 8.1 K (Figure 12). Fitting

the magnetic data according to the Curie−Weiss law yields to a

strong positive Weiss constant of θ = 30.3 K. From the

(8χMT)1/2vs T curve, a room-temperature value of the eﬀective

magnetic moment of μeff(exp) = 3.34μBwas obtained, which is

agreement with the spin-only value for Ni2+(S =1,g = 2). On

cooling, an increase in the χ MT curve is observed indicative of

ferromagnetic interactions between the nickel(II) cations, and

on further cooling, this curve drops dramatically (Supporting

Information, Figure S27).

Magnetization measurements at 2 K in the range of 0−90

kOe show a sigmoidal shape indicative of metamagnetic

behavior (Supporting Information, Figure S28). From the

ﬁrst derivative of the initial curve, the critical ﬁeld, HC, was

determined as 1.4 kOe. A magnetization loop experiment at 2 K

in the range ±10 kOe showed a small hysteresis (Figure 13).

Temperature dependent magnetic measurement above the

critical ﬁeld was performed at H DC= 2 kOe, which clearly

shows the transition into a saturated paramagnetic phase. The

ordering temperature of T C= 10.0 K was obtained from the

ﬁrst derivative of the susceptibility curve. To analyze the

saturated paramagnetic phase in more detail, ZFC/FC (zero-

ﬁeld cooled/ﬁeld-cooled) measurements were performed, in

which a small splitting typically for ferromagnetic behavior can

be observed (Supporting Information, Figure S29). Further M

versus H measurements at diﬀerent temperatures below the

antiferromagnetic ordering temperature and temperature

dependent measurements at diﬀerent magnetic ﬁelds below

the critical ﬁelds were combined to prepare the phase diagram,

which is typical for a metamagnet (Figure 14 and Figures S30−

S31 in the Supporting Information).82−84

■CONCLUSIONS

In the present contribution, a large number of new

coordination compounds based on transition metal thiocya-

nates and 4-ethylpyridine as coligand are reported. Several of

them crystallize in diﬀerent polymorphic modiﬁcations.

Interestingly, for the compounds of composition M-

(NCS)2(L)4, Fe and Ni have the same structure in the

thermodynamically stable form at room-temperature, whereas

the one with Mn prefers a diﬀerent structural arrangement. For

the compounds of composition M(NCS)2(L)2, however, only

one common modiﬁcation is found, which is thermodynami-

cally stable for Ni but metastable for Mn. This nicely

demonstrates that even for such simple compounds, where

normally isotypic structures are expected, several polymorphic

modiﬁcations can be found. Additionally, some new metastable

forms were detected by thermal decomposition of suitable

precursor compounds. One Fe compound was obtained by the

solid state route, and it was shown that it cannot be prepared in

solution, which shows the high potential of this alternative solid

state, decomposition based, synthetic approach. Moreover, on

thermal decomposition, a further compound of unusual

stoichiometry is observed for which a more condensed 1D

structure is expected. Unfortunately the structure of this

compound is still unknown, and because the pattern cannot be

indexed, it cannot be excluded that a small amount of

contamination or a second modiﬁcation is present. From our

magnetic investigations, there is no hint of paramagnetic

contamination, which would be clearly visible in the

antiferromagnetic phase. However, magnetic measurements

reveal that it is a metamagnet, and it can be expected that the

antiferromagnetic interactions are mediated by the metal

thiocyanato chains. For the two modiﬁcations of manganese

with μ-1,3-bridging anions antiferromagnetism is observed with

similar ordering temperatures. Finally, as expected, all

compounds with only terminal N-bonded thiocyanato anions

show simple Curie−Weiss paramagnetism without magnetic

anomalies, and thus μ-1,3-bridging compounds must be

prepared if cooperative magnetic properties should be

generated.
